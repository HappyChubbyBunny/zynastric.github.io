## Scene Commands
These commands will pull up different scenes from my OBS for the Twitch stream! Helpful for moments I forget to switch after a yap session and forget to show gameplay.
| Command | Alias' | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Screen | `!screen`, `!Screen` | Pulls up the fullscreen view of the game |
| Hybrid Screen | `!hscreen`, `!hybridScreen` | Pulls up the screen with the bigger chat box and smaller game screen + camera. |
| Intermission | `!intermission`, `!fullscreenCamera`, `!cameraScreen` | The camera will go full screen. |
| Be Right Back | `!BRB`, `!brb` | Goes to the BRB screen. |

> [!CAUTION]
> I don't mind a bit of trolling with the scenes, as long as it's not excessive- obviously. However, if I'm on intermission to avoid showing private information or on the BRB, **_please_ try to avoid changing it unless I'm present**.

## Words on Screen
These commands will allow you to toggle words that appear on screen as well as what those words say!
| Command | Alias' | Syntax | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Words on Screen | `!wos`, `!WOS` | !wos `insert message here` | Changes the words on screen. | !wos Zyn stinky |
| Words Toggle | `!wot`, `!WOT` | !wot | Toggles the words on screen. | !wot |

> [!WARNING]
> I've noticed some issues regarding these commands, with OBS crashing after use. Please feel free to use it, but if possible, avoid spamming it, as I'm still unsure what's causing the crashes.

## Death Counter
These commands allow an overlay to play a short animation of deaths accrued for specific games, as well as allowing the resetting and removing of deaths.
| Command | Alias' | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Current Deaths | `!deaths` | Shows the number of cumulative deaths in chat. |
| Add Death | `!death+`, `!deathAdd`, `!addDeath` | Adds a single death to the count and plays an animation. |
| Remove Death | `!death-`, `!deathSub`, `!subDeath` | Subtracts a death from the total, no animation but will show up in chat. |
| Reset Deaths | `!resetDeaths`, `!resetDeath`, `!deathReset`, `!deathsReset` | Resets the death count for the current game. |

## Pokemon
Mod commands for the on-screen Pokémon- allowing for resetting, fixing, and spawning of Pokémon!
| Command | Alias' | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Poke End | `!pokeEnd`, `!poke-end` | Gets rid of the Pokémon currently on-screen. |
| Poke Fix | `!pokeFix`, `!poke-fix`, `!pokeReset`, `!poke-reset` | Resets the poke catch reward on Twitch when it bugs out, so people can catch the Pokémon. |
| Poke Pause | `!pokePause`, `!pokePause` | Stops Pokémon from spawning in naturally or by chat. |
| Poke Spawn | `!pokeSpawn`, `!poke-spawn`, `!poke spawn` | Unlike subs, mods can spawn Pokémon **without cooldown**, **_please_ don't spam it too much though**. |

## Raid Messages
These will summon messages for chat to copy and paste when raiding into another streamer!
| Command | Alias' | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Follower Raid Message | `!raidFollow` | Posts the raid message for Followers to copy and paste. |
| Subbed Raid Message | `!raidSub` | Posts the raid message for Subs to copy and paste. |

> [!NOTE]
> The reason we have two separate commands for followers and subbers is that followers are unable to use specific commands.
